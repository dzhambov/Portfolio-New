          <p>"I worked with and along side Hristo on multiple occasions while we were both attending Epicodus. He showed
            every day that he was not afraid to work outside his comfort zone and tackle new concepts and big
            projects.<br>
            He made large leaps in his programing abilities from week to week and showed a clear ability to learn
            quickly and not get frustrated when he hit technical hurtles. He was clearly driven, passionate, and would
            fill down time by doing coding challenges or working to improve older projects. Furthermore, Hristo was
            always willing to take time away from his projects to help others and provide positive encouragement. <br>

            I would love to have an opportunity to work with Hristo in the future."</p>

          <p>“I had the pleasure of working with Hristo for several years in my fine-dining establishment in the Beacon
            Hill area of Boston. Hristo is bright, motivated, and confident; someone who devotes himself to his position
            and would so in any organization.<br>

            Hristo engages when needed, never asked, and always had his guests interests in the forefront of his work.
            His motivation and determination allowed him to work on other projects when not at work, but never lost
            sight of his work when present.<br>

            It would be a privilege to work alongside Hristo in the future in any of his endeavors”</p>
